# Language model training examples

The following example showcases how to train a language model from scratch 
using the JAX/Flax backend.

JAX/Flax allows you to trace pure functions and compile them into efficient, fused accelerator code on both GPU and TPU.
Models written in JAX/Flax are **immutable** and updated in a purely functional
way which enables simple and efficient model parallelism.

## Masked language modeling

In the following, we demonstrate how to train a bi-directional transformer model 
using masked language modeling objective as introduced in [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).
More specifically, we demonstrate how JAX/Flax can be leveraged 
to pre-train [**`roberta-base`**](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base)
in Norwegian on a single TPUv3-8 pod.

The example script uses the ðŸ¤— Datasets library. You can easily customize them to your needs if you need extra processing on your datasets.

Let's start by creating a folder to save the trained model and a symbolic link to the `run_mlm_flax.py` script.

```bash
export MODEL_DIR="./norwegian-roberta-base"
mkdir -p ${MODEL_DIR}
ln -s ~/transformers/examples/flax/language-modeling/run_mlm_flax.py run_mlm_flax.py
```

### Train tokenizer

In the first step, we train a tokenizer to efficiently process the text input for the model. Similar to how it is shown in [How to train a new language model from scratch using Transformers and Tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-train), we use a **`ByteLevelBPETokenizer`**.
The tokenizer is trained on the complete Norwegian dataset of OSCAR
and consequently saved in `${MODEL_DIR}`
This can take up to 10 minutes depending on your hardware â˜•.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from tokenizers import trainers, Tokenizer, normalizers, ByteLevelBPETokenizer

model_dir = "./norwegian-roberta-base"  # ${MODEL_DIR}

# load dataset
dataset = load_dataset("oscar", "unshuffled_deduplicated_no", split="train")

# Instantiate tokenizer
tokenizer = ByteLevelBPETokenizer()

def batch_iterator(batch_size=1000):
    for i in range(0, len(dataset), batch_size):
        yield dataset[i: i + batch_size]["text"]

# Customized training
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(batch_iterator(), vocab_size=50265, min_frequency=2, special_tokens=[
    "<s>",
    "<pad>",
    "</s>",
    "<unk>",
    "<mask>",
])

# Save files to disk
tokenizer.save(f"{model_dir}/tokenizer.json")
```

### Create configuration

Next, we create the model's configuration file. This is as simple 
as loading and storing [`**roberta-base**`](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base)
in the local model folder:

```python
from transformers import RobertaConfig

model_dir = "./norwegian-roberta-base"  # ${MODEL_DIR}

config = RobertaConfig.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
config.save_pretrained(model_dir)
```

### Train model

Next we can run the example script to pretrain the model:

```bash
./run_mlm_flax.py \
        --output_dir="./runs" \
        --model_type="roberta" \
        --config_name="${MODEL_DIR}" \
        --tokenizer_name="${MODEL_DIR}" \
        --dataset_name="oscar" \
        --dataset_config_name="unshuffled_deduplicated_no" \
        --max_seq_length="128" \
        --weight_decay="0.01" \
        --per_device_train_batch_size="128" \
        --per_device_eval_batch_size="128" \
        --learning_rate="3e-4" \
        --warmup_steps="1000" \
        --overwrite_output_dir \
        --pad_to_max_length \
        --num_train_epochs="18" \
        --adam_beta1="0.9" \
        --adam_beta2="0.98"
```

Training should converge at a loss and accuracy 
of 1.78 and 0.64 respectively after 18 epochs on a single TPUv3-8.
This should take less than 18 hours.
Training statistics can be accessed on [tfhub.de](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/GdYmdak2TWeVz0DDRYOrrg).
